# Testing

We want to test because we want to catch the possible errors on our program. 
It helps us save time debugging and think about possible issues and bugs we might encounter.

Automated tests can be run whenever we update any part of our application without we having to test everything manually again.

## Types of tests

1. Unit Tests - tests written to test a fully isolated part of our code. Ex. test one function.

2. Integration Tests - tests written to test a code that has dependencies. Ex. testing one function that calls another function.

3. End-to-End (E2E) Test - test written to test the full flow of the user interface. Ex. test full application or part of it.
